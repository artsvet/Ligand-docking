# Ligand-docking
Tools  to generate and convert ligand data, automation tools for protein-ligand binding screen.

Chemistry and biology involves data with many different representations, 
either variable contextual labels or formats with multiple levels of complexity.
The Ligand docking library provides an API to computational chemistry libraries for 
visualizing, formatting, or exporting for further use in binding screens. 

The pipeline now implements both AutoDock VINA, the most widely used software for molecular docking simulation
using a genetic algorithm and united-atom scoring function, and the new state-of-the-art deep learning model
